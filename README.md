# Product-Catalog
This is my second project- Product catalog as a beginner in HTML.
It basically shows a catalog of different products which you can achieve via the bookmark anchor tag at the starting of the project.
This project during implementation made me learn a new tag called details and summary tag using which I can hide my contents and display them upon user's click.
